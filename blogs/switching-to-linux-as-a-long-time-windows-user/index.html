        <h1>Switching to Linux as a long time Windows user</h1>
        <p>Switching to Linux is hard. I told myself I would use windows until windows 10 becomes obsolete and I'm
            forced to switch, but microsoft made some decisions that made me say enough is enough and I made the switch.
            After using Linux for a year now, I would like to share my experiences, and maybe help guide people who are
            curious about switching to Linux, but are too scared to, or are unsure.</p>
        <h2>Picking a distro</h2>
        <p>Picking a distro is probably one of the hardest parts of switching to Linux and what drives a lot of people
            away. There are so many options to choose from, and it's hard to know which one is the best for you. A lot
            of people will suggest distros like Ubuntu or Mint because they're often considered the easiest to install,
            but that may be a bad choice, especially if you are on newer hardware.</p>
        <p> Ubuntu and Mint are not built on the
            latest drivers since updates come in releases rather than just getting updates as they come. While this is
            good for stability and knowing the packages will play nice with each other, this means that if you were to
            install Ubuntu or Mint on relatively new hardware, things might just not work. You could just swap out old
            packages for new ones, but that likely means having to touch the command line, which can be intimidating.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's also the issue of how the easy way to install software for users through a graphical interface is
            through snaps (on ubuntu) or flatpaks. There are sometimes issues that only exist in the flatpak or snap
            versions of packages, for example, the steam snap has lots of issues and it's encouraged to just install it
            from the .deb package instead. That wouldn't be the fault of the user to just assume it would work after
            installing it though. I've had friends tell me that firefox isn't working properly after installing the
            flatpak version, and I told them to try the native package instead, and all of a sudden it fixed. This is a
            shame, because installing packages this way is so simple and easy, and flatpaks have the feature of being
            containerized, meaning they run isolated from everything else and you can choose what it has access to,
            which may be appealing to some people.
        <p>The way you would get the latest native packages for your system is through its package manager. On Debian
            based systems, it would be apt, Arch based systems use pacman. If you're uncomfortable using a terminal, GUI
            applications do exist to make using your native package manager more user friendly. There's pamac for arch
            based systems, created by manjaro, it also supports snaps and flatpaks. Gnome software has support for deb,
            rpm, flatpak, snap, arch repo, and aur packages, and is installed by default on many distrobutions using
            gnome like Ubuntu and Fedora.</p>
        <p>So what should you choose? Well, I don't know. I can't tell you what distro will be the best for you, but I
            can give some recommendations. If you want a distro that is easy to install and is built on relatively new
            packages, Fedora might be a good choice. If you're okay with touching the command line a bit but want an
            easy installation, Endeavour OS is pretty nice, and arch based, meaning you'll get access to the latest
            packages and the aur. My
            personal choice is Arch, since I prefer having the latest packages, and I enjoy tinkering with my system. It
            doesn't have the easiest installation process though, and from what I've heard archinstall can be pretty hit
            or miss, but if it works then hey, good for you.</p>
        <p>If you want to test distros and see which one you're most comfortable with, you can take a USB stick and
            install <a href="https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html">ventoy</a> on it. This will let you just drag and
            drop isos into it and you can choose which one to boot
            when you boot the usb, giving you a live environment to play around with and try various distros without
            actually installing it.
        </p>
        <h2>Desktop Environments</h2>
        <p>Choosing a desktop environment is as important as the choosing the OS. If you're coming from windows, you
            probably don't know what a desktop environment is. When you think windows, you think of the desktop
            environment and OS as one thing. On Linux, you can choose the OS and desktop environment independently of
            each other. Think of it
            like this: the OS you choose governs the package management system you'll use, and what base packages it'll
            be installed with. The desktop environment is the graphical user interface where you do all your regular
            computer things like having a desktop and taskbar, and all your personalization and theming.</p>
        <p>Some of the most popular desktop environments are KDE Plasma, Gnome, and Cinnamon, all with their distinct
            look and reasons they may appeal to you. My personal choice is KDE Plasma as it offers a lot of
            customization and is very solid. This doesn't mean the others don't, this is just my personal favorite.</p>
        <h3>I installed KDE Plasma and the login screen looks terrible</h3>
        <p>Go to your plasma settings and search for sddm, and set the theme to breeze.</p>
        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>Gaming on Linux is very good, especially if you're using the latest packages. These last few years especially
            have been very good and rapidly getting better because of Valve's contributions to Linux gaming. Proton
            usually just works, just remember to enable steam play for all other titles under steam's compatibility
            settings so you can actually run games with proton.</p>

                decoding="async" width="90%">
        </picture>
        <p>Usually, the latest proton version provided by steam is more than enough to play games. Some brand new games
            might not work for whatever reason on regular proton though, that's why I
            recommend trying out Proton-GE. Proton-GE is built off the latest proton build, but with extra features,
            including support for more codecs, and even fixes for specific games. 99% of the time proton should work, so
            you probably don't <i>need</i> Proton-GE, it's just nice to have.</p>
        <h3>Isn't NVIDIA terrible on Linux?</h3>
        <p>It used to be, and probably still is on some distros that don't have the latest drivers installed by default,
            but as of recent, it has been amazing. AMD gpus have drivers in the kernel already, so all you would need to
            do is install mesa and you're good to go to play games. NVIDIA doesn't have its drivers built in by default
            though, so you have to install them yourself first, and if you're on wayland, you have to set up kernel
            modesetting as well. What is kernel modesetting? I honestly don't know, but you have to set it up yourself,
            or else it'll suck a lot. This is all assuming you're using the NVIDIA proprietary drivers, since I don't
            think Nouveau is quite at the point to play games reliably yet.</p>
        <p>Since proton converts graphics api calls to vulkan, I often find myself getting a lot more performance in
            games than I was getting in windows, which surprised me a lot. I had assumed that games would run slightly
            worse on Linux, but I've actually been able to do even more than I could before.</p>
        <p>It's also worth mentioning that some games with Linux builds run terribly and are ironically better to run
            using proton, like Dusk. Whether it's because Linux is a low priority, or it wasn't tested at all, just be
            wary of that. Terraria's Linux build is good at least. Similarly, apps like discord have poor Linux support,
            so I recommend installing a community made discord client called Vesktop. Vesktop is built around linux and
            might actually be more featured than vanilla discord without any of the vencord mods turn on.</p>
        <h3>Anticheats</h3>
        <p>Because Proton runs in userspace, and not on the kernel level, games requiring kernel level anticheat will
            not work. That means no Destiny 2 or Fortnite. They can absolutely run, but you'll trip the anticheat
            quickly. Some kernel level anticheats provide linux versions with support for proton, like easy anticheat,
            but it's up to the developer whether to allow linux or not.</p>
        <p>Personally I believe that with enough work, you can make a server-side anticheat solution that can catch
            cheating just as well as a kernel level anticheat can. Often times Linux is excluded arbitrarily by the
            creators of a
            game, whether it's through uninformed decision making, or because they just don't care because Linux would
            barely get them any market share by allowing it. This sucks a lot for people who aren't cheating and just
            want to play a game.</p>
        <p>Some games that choose not to support Linux can still be run though, there's a specific proton version for
            running league of legends for example, and there are people making it possible to play roblox on Linux as
            well. I have zero interest in these games, but maybe it matters more to someone else.</p>
        <h2>What about regular windows programs?</h2>
        <p>Wine is what you would use to run windows programs outside of games on steam. Usually it would be better to
            use a Linux version of an app if it exists, but if a Linux version doesn't exist, you can try it with wine.
            For example, some mod installers for games will work perfectly under wine. Speaking of, steam lets you pass
            WINEDLLOVERRIDES in your launch options, giving you easy dll injection, which makes modding easier in some
            cases. Now, while wine is great and all, it can't run everything well. It can surprise me sometimes, for
            example, running RTCV under wine worked perfectly and the emulators run by RTCV running under wine had good
            performance, allowing me to do my shenanigans. Try wine on something like adobe software though and you'll
            have bad luck, which brings us to our next topic.
        </p>
        <h2>Adobe and Linux</h2>
        <p>The truth is, if you need to use adobe software, you probably can't make the switch. There are simply no good
            alternatives to general programs like photoshop. If you're already used to using premiere pro, why would you
            want to switch to davinci resolve or kdenlive now? It just isn't viable for some people to go without these
            programs, especially if it's for their job. Don't get me wrong, there's amazing software out there that can
            be used professionally, like Krita for art, or Inkscape for vector graphics. Photoshop though, doesn't
            really have any good alternatives. Don't listen to people who say GIMP. GIMP is not a photoshop replacement,
            and while it does have some nice features, you definitely won't be able to use it for school with its
            terrible name, and it's nowhere as featured as photoshop.</p>
        <p>So what can you do about this? Well, I honestly don't know. If you can give up adobe software for
            alternatives, then it might be worth the switch, otherwise, you'll just have to wait until a reliable
            alternative is made. This all sucks too, because it's not even an issue of a lack of an open source
            alternative for Linux, it's a lack of any good alternatives at all for Linux. If I had the time and energy,
            I would love to make the software that solves this issue, but I don't think I'll be able to do such a thing.
        </p>
        <h2>What's the point?</h2>
        <p>If you value having user freedom, Linux allows for it. It is a highly open source, community driven project
            constantly growing and improving. With some of microsoft's recent decisions, it would make sense to be
            uncomfortable using windows. Linux isn't perfect, but it's always getting better, and gives you the freedom
            to choose what you want to use. If you want to use proprietary software, go for it, it doesn't matter what
            anyone says.</p>
        <p>The hardest part of Linux is probably having to learn Linux when you're already used to windows. I won't
            sugarcoat it, it was hard learning everything and making the switch, but with enough time, and help from
            people I love, I was able to set up the best experience with a computer I've had in my life, and now I can
            teach other people. When you're learning something, don't be afraid to ask for help. You're not stupid for
            not understanding something, you're not inferior for using archinstall, it just takes time to learn things.
            If you don't know anyone who can help you with Linux if you're new to it, you can always reach out to me.
            I've helped multiple people with Linux in the past and I would be happy to help. My contact info is on my
